# CoinMarketCap-API-
Data Visualization using the CoinMarketCap API (yes I like crypto)

Steps:
1. Get your own Coinmarketcap api key from their website

2. Create a file called "cmc_api_key.py file"
    Add variable "api_key" = '(your api key goes here)'

3.Go to portfolio.py file 
   Update variable values for "BTC,ETH,XLM,XMR,ALGO,ADA"
    BTC = 0.1999 # + 0.024 
   If new variables are added then have fun making a million changes to the code

4. Go to starburst.py file or calculations.py if you hate cool graphs
    Run it and enjoy the starburst
