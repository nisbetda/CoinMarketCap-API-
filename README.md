# CoinMarketCap-API-
Data Visualization using the CoinMarketCap API (yes I like crypto)

Get your own Coinmarketcap api key from their website

Create your own cmc_api_key.py file 
  Add api_key = '(your api key goes here)'

Go to portfolio.py file 
 Update variable values for "BTC,ETH,XLM,XMR,ALGO,ADA"
  BTC = 0.1999 # + 0.024 
 If new variables are added then have fun making a million changes to the code
 
Go to starburst.py file or calculations if you hate cool graphs
Run it and enjoy the starburst
